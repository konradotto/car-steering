## Code of conduct

#### How do we plan to collaborate?
* Regular meetings will be held online over discord.

* Sprints last a week and a Trello is set up with a sprint backlog containing work items to make it easier to allocate tasks.

* We will use Scrum and utilize trello to allocate our selves to tasks. We will also have a Scrum master that rotates weekly.

#### How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?
* A kanban Trello board for visualizing work items of a sprint and their status.
* Our definition of done contains that code is peer-reviewed. Individual contributions therefore need to be committed by Saturday evening to allow for other team-members to review them. This will improve code quality and ensure a general understanding of all parts of our project.

#### What is our usual communication plan?

We are planning to have 3 fixed meetings a week (see [sprint schedule](#sprint-schedule)). These meetings will be held on a dedicated Discord server.

Besides these meetings we are available for communication via text (simple questions) and voice-chat (further discussions, collaboration, fixing issues, coding sessions) on our Discord server.

Our sprintboard on Trello and the progress in the GitLab repository will help us monitor the project progress in between meetings.

Summarised, we will be communicating via the following channels:
- A dedicated Discord server
- A dedicated Whatsapp group
- Trello
- GitLab
