## Code of conduct

#### Project plan:

Our project plan is closely based off the individual and group assignments given
on Canvas:

* Each group assignment is handled as a project milestone

* Internal deadlines for group assignments are 7 days before the Canvas deadline this is reflected in the milestone due dates on GitLab

* Milestones are split into activities that are based off the steps necessary to fulfill the assignment

* Activities are distributed among team members during sprint planning

* Progress is tracked through Trello (cards), GitLab (issues and milestones) and our regular communication in and outside our scheduled stand-up meetings 


#### How do we plan to collaborate?
* Regular meetings will be held online over discord.

* Sprints last a week and a Trello is set up with a sprint backlog containing work items to make it easier to allocate tasks.

* We will use Scrum and utilize trello to allocate our selves to tasks. We will also have a Scrum master that rotates weekly.

###### Sunday:  Retrospective + Sprint Planning
* Time: Flexible, default at 13:00.

* Agenda:
1. Each member states the progress and the state of the work item assigned to them.
2. Unforeseen difficulties shall be discussed and documented, in case they occured.    
3. Agree on the outcome of the incoming sprint.

#### How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?
* A kanban Trello board for visualizing work items of a sprint and their status.

* Our definition of done contains that code is peer-reviewed. Individual contributions therefore need to be committed by Saturday evening to allow for other team-members to review them. This will improve code quality and ensure a general understanding of all parts of our project.

The reason we include weekends in our schedule is because of the current COVID-19 pandemic situation. 
Due to the quarantine currently happening, we thought a weekend day was alright to be allocated as well since we got nothing better to do. 
We also would like to space out a meeting day to allow members to work on their assigned tasks to then discuss on a bigger scale what has been done those days.
 
* There are multiple factors that can cause a task to be delayed, ranging from miscommunication to viruses. Due to this, there are few things we need to do to address the unexpected delays:
    * We need to track the team progress regularly.
    * Keep a regular communication flow.
* On Sundays we will assign tasks that will last for a week, a Sprint. These tasks will then be progress checked on thursday where we need a small presentation of the progress: 
    * If the progress is slow, or there are circumstances that we as a team feel will hinder achievement of this task on time, we will allocate more resources in the form of time and manpower in that one task.
    * If the task is delayed, we need to evaluate the reason why, whether it is that the scope of that task was too big, or the effort was low etc. once identified we need to place measures to prevent this from happening again.

______

#### How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?
* We ensure knowledge transfer through sharing required information sources on our communication platforms and addressing any issues in related meetings.

* We will use code review at the end of each sprint where contributors have to be able to explain and justify their implemented methods.  

______

#### What is our usual communication plan?

We are planning to have 3 fixed meetings a week (see [sprint schedule](#sprint-schedule)). These meetings will be held on a dedicated Discord server.

Besides these meetings we are available for communication via text (simple questions) and voice-chat (further discussions, collaboration, fixing issues, coding sessions) on our Discord server.

Our sprintboard on Trello and the progress in the GitLab repository will help us monitor the project progress in between meetings.

Summarised, we will be communicating via the following channels:
- A dedicated Discord server
- A dedicated Whatsapp group
- Trello
- GitLab

______

#### How will we solve conflicts? 

* Responsibilities are divided so we need to ensure each member understands their task. Each member will be responsible to be honest with the group and if members are stuck, the issue should be resolved before the deadline of the task. 

* Each member is responsible for showing up to the meetings that are in place and shall communicate in case they cannot join. In cases where a member misses meetings regularly or does not communicate about it, the procedures to be taken will be discussed and considered to take place after consulting the course organizer.

* In case of a conflict between two members, the two will have to communicate directly to each other in a constructive manner. If the conflict is not resolved, the team should get involved to find a solution to the issue. If the team's opinion is split, the team will ask for an additional opinion outside of the team, most likely a TA, and if it still is not resolved, a random draw will be made to randomly select a solution and the team has to accept the outcome.


#### Agreed by

We have all agreed to adhere to this code of conduct and will sign this with a commit adding our names:
