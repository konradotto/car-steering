#### What is our usual communication plan?

We are planning to have 3 fixed meetings a week (see [sprint schedule](#sprint-schedule)). These meetings will be held on a dedicated Discord server.

Besides these meetings we are available for communication via text (simple questions) and voice-chat (further discussions, collaboration, fixing issues, coding sessions) on our Discord server.

Our sprintboard on Trello and the progress in the GitLab repository will help us monitor the project progress in between meetings.

Summarised, we will be communicating via the following channels:
- A dedicated Discord server
- A dedicated Whatsapp group
- Trello
- GitLab
